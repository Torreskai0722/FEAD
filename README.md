# FEAD
Fuel efficient autonomous driving project

## 09/01/2020 
### Liangkai To Do list: 
 - Check the VT dataset and try our models on the dataset
 - Try former models (MLP, LR, PR, CNN, LSTM, etc.) with accelaration included as a feature and remove the abnormal data (after row 825000)


## 09/09/2020
### publication avenue
 - transportation: IEEE ITS, IV, ...
 - robotics: ICRA, IROS
 - others: MetroCAD ??
### experiments
 - VT dataset request (find the first author, linkedin)
 - VT polynomial method on our dataset (improve R2 close to number in their paper)
 - Use speed and acc only in our method to compare with VT method
### method
 - transfer/meta learning for fitting a general model to each truck
 - high accurate data (from fuel meter) vs. EMS/ECU CAN data, how to convert ??
